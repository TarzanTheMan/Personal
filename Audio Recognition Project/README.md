# KERAS MUSIC GENRE CLASSIFICATION
This project was completed as a final for a Big Data Technology class during my Masters of Data Analytics program at UTSA under Dr. Paul Rad. The purpose of this project is to analyze eight different music genres and create a neural network capabale of accurately classifying the music via imported audio clips.

## DATA
The data for this project can be downloaded from here: https://www.github.com/mdeff/fma </br>
There are over 8,000 songs (30-second clips) from 8 balanced genres. The GitHub contains additional file size options, but due to computational power I was limited to the zip folder titled fma_small.zip. The tracks.csv and features.csv, located in the GitHub repository underlined above, are essential to completing this project.
