# WELCOME
Personal repository detailing adventures in academia and beyond! The primary purpose of this repository is to organize all of my projects, research, and interests in various data science techniques leveraged using Python 3. 

## ABOUT ME
Hello and thanks for visiting my page! My name is Adam Burrows and currently I work as a federal defense contractor for the U.S. Air Force at Randolph AFB. I am a Senior Data Scientist with nearly 5 years of broad data analytics experience, and an emphasized passion in big data solutions and machine learning technologies. The position I'm in now is on a project management team overseeing the biggest effort the Air Force has ever conducted and one that will literally transform the entire Air Force Education and Training Command (AETC). Originally from Houston, San Antonio is where I temporarily settled down while I finished college at UTSA, graduating cum laude with my Bachelors in Mathematics and a minor in Applied Statistics. Continuous education is extremely important to me, which is why I returned to UTSA for the College of Business Masters in Data Analytics cohort. My primary focus today is honing my technical skills while developing a business acumen that rivals the MBAs. Outside of work I enjoy world traveling (currently visited 4 continents), extreme sports, and exercising. I am overly ambitious; if you ask me, I will happily share my 10-year road map and how I plan to achieve each milestone.
